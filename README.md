![coffee-list-app-image](https://github.com/jelinden/kotlin-react-app/raw/main/coffee-list-app.png)

server directory is for kotlin backend

and client is for react app

## building server

You can use for example `./gradlew run` in server directory.

`./gradlew build` just does the build.

You can also see and use `run-local.sh` script or client/package.json also.

## building client

`react-scripts build` or see `package.json` for other solutions.

Basically we want to serve the built files through the server.
